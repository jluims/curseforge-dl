# curseforge-dl
Easily and efficiently download CurseForge modpacks.

## Features:
- No ads
- Multithreading (very fast!)
- Easily view progress/downloads size

## Who is this for?
If you use another launcher like multimc or the default Minecraft launcher, you might not want to install a slow and ad-ridden CurseForge on your computer.

## How to use:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
4. Download your modpack ZIP file from CurseForge, extract, and copy the manifest.json next to dl.py
5. Run `python3 dl.py` or `py dl.py` (preferably in a CMD/powershell window, if on Windows)
6. Wait for it to finish
7. Enjoy :D

Your mods will be in a mods/ folder in the same directory as dl.py
